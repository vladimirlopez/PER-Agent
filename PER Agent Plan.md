# Multi-Agent Physics Education Research Assistant: Implementation Plan

This project leverages local LLMs and multi-agent architecture to automate physics education research tasks, from literature discovery to formatted report generation. The system is optimized for an RTX 5070 Ti (16GB VRAM) and integrates seamlessly with GitHub Copilot Agent in VSCode.

---

## 1. **Core Architecture**

**Framework:**  
- **LangGraph (recommended):** For stateful workflows, graph-based process visualization, agent orchestration, and robust error handling.

**Agents:**
1. **Literature Scout Agent**
   - Model: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
   - Searches arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, ranks papers by relevance.
2. **Document Analyzer Agent**
   - Model: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
   - Parses PDFs, extracts key findings from papers.
3. **Physics Specialist Agent**
   - Model: Qwen2.5-Math-7B + DeepSeek-R1-14B
   - Validates physics concepts, checks mathematical accuracy.
4. **Content Synthesizer Agent**
   - Model: Mistral-Small-22B
   - Combines insights, identifies patterns and contradictions.
5. **Report Generator Agent**
   - Model: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B
   - Generates formatted reports (LaTeX/Markdown/PDF).
6. **Quality Controller Agent**
   - Model: DeepSeek-R1-14B
   - Reviews outputs for accuracy, consistency, academic standards.

## 2. **Phased Implementation Timeline**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)**
- Environment setup: Install Ollama, required LLMs
- VSCode: Enable GitHub Copilot Agent mode (`chat.agent.enabled: true`)
- Initialize LangGraph framework, define the core agent structure

### **Phase 2: Agent Development (Weeks 2-3)**
- Code individual agents using Copilot assistance
- Integrate APIs: arXiv, Semantic Scholar, PDF parsing
- Develop and test agent pipelines, mock data for unit tests

### **Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Week 4)**
- Multi-agent orchestration via LangGraph
- Quality control feedback loop: Allows corrections and resubmissions
- Add error handling, logging, and status monitoring

### **Phase 4: GUI Development (Optional, Week 5)**
- Integrate Streamlit for a professional GUI
- Visualize agent status and progress
- Add research history, download buttons, and analytics dashboard

## 3. **Recommended LLMs for RTX 5070 Ti (16GB VRAM)**
| Model                       | VRAM Usage | Context Length | Task                   |
|-----------------------------|------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct (Q4_K_M)| ~14GB      | 32K           | Lead researcher, ranking|
| DeepSeek-R1-14B (Q4_K_M)    | ~9GB       | 64K           | Reasoning, quality     |
| Qwen2.5-Math-7B             | ~7GB       | 64K           | Physics/math tasks     |
| Mistral-Small-22B (Q4_K_M)  | ~12GB      | 32K           | Content synthesis      |
| Qwen2.5-Coder-7B            | ~7GB       | 64K           | Code/report generation |

## 4. **GitHub Copilot Agent Integration**

- Use Copilot Agent for boilerplate class creation, async workflow handling, API integration, and documentation.
- Employ Copilot chat for planning agent interactions and automated test generation.
- Refactor code across agents and orchestrator with Copilot multi-file suggestions.

---

## 5. **Sample User Session**

1. **Startup:** Launch VSCode, start Ollama server, run `python research_assistant.py`
2. **Input:** Enter research question (e.g. "Effectiveness of wave simulations in high school teaching")
3. **Agent Workflow:**
    - Literature Scout finds papers
    - Analyzer extracts main findings
    - Physics Specialist validates concepts
    - Synthesizer integrates insights
    - Report Generator formats complete report
    - Quality Controller reviews final output
4. **Output:** Download research report as PDF/LaTeX, review summary, view analytics.

---

## 6. **Streamlit GUI (Optional, Highly Recommended)**

- Sidebar: System status, research history, model selection, settings
- Main area: Tabs for new research, results, and analytics
- Visualizes agent progress in real-time
- One-click downloads, interactive summaries
- Great for teaching, collaboration, and professional presentations

---

## 7. **Best Practices**

- Monitor VRAM/cpu usage, use quantized (Q4_K_M) models when possible
- Implement automated tests for each agent
- Save and visualize research history
- Use async/await for I/O and API calls
- Start CLI; then add GUI (Streamlit) after core logic verified

---

## 8. **Next Steps**

- Build phased agent classes & orchestrator in VSCode with Copilot
- Run integration tests for workflow
- Deploy locally; demo with Streamlit GUI for full impact

**This plan is ready to collaborate in VSCode with GitHub Copilot Agent for efficient, test-driven development.**
